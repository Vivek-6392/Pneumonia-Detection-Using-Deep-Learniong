#🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning
This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained and evaluated using a publicly available dataset to classify images as either Pneumonia or Normal. The goal is to assist in faster and more accurate diagnosis of pneumonia using automated image analysis.

🔍 Key Features
Image classification using CNN architecture.

Trained on chest X-ray datasets (e.g., from Kaggle or NIH).

High accuracy and performance metrics on validation and test data.

Jupyter Notebook for model development and experimentation.

Visualization of training process and confusion matrix for evaluation.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used includes chest X-ray images labeled as "Pneumonia" and "Normal". Common sources:

Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook


📈 Results
Achieved high validation accuracy and strong F1-score, demonstrating the model's ability to distinguish between pneumonia and healthy cases.

📌 Future Improvements
Incorporate more advanced architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).

Add GUI or web interface for image uploads.

Integrate Grad-CAM or saliency maps for explainability.
